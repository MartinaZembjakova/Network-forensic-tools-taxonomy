# Network Forensics Tools and Datasets

It is useful to have an overview of tools used in network forensics with its basic description. The overview of available tools helps to choose the suitable tool that can assist in obtaining the information, collecting and analyzing the evidence, or creating the reports. This survey contains several network tools that can help during the network forensic processes and are described in its section [TOOLS](network-forensic-tools).

It is also useful to have some data that can be analyzed using the network tools. Some public datasets are described in detail in section [DATASETS](network-datasets).

This website is based on the master's thesis "Network Forensics Tools Survey and Taxonomy."
